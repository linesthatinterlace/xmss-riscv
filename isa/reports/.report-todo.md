# LaTeX Report TODO

Convert xmss_rv64_isa_profile.md into a clean technical report PDF.

## Intended audience
Francois Dupressoir (supervisor) — formal verification cryptographer,
Jasmin/EasyCrypt ecosystem, University of Bristol. Knows Jasmin deeply;
does not need it explained. Needs XMSS motivation and RISC-V rationale
stated crisply.

## Style
Clean technical report (not theorem-paper aesthetic). Readable prose,
not narrow-margin Computer Modern. Think: well-formatted memo with tables.

## Content outline
1. Context: what XMSS is, why Jasmin, why RISC-V, why this analysis now
2. Methodology: toolchain (riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc 13.3 / -march=rv64gc),
   what binaries were analysed (12 test binaries from the C reference impl)
3. Findings: tables from the report — RV64I dominates, M for compiler
   arithmetic only, no Zb
4. Key implication: the Zbb/rotation question lives entirely in the hash
   layer (SHA-256 compression), not in XMSS algorithm logic. This
   reinforces the algorithm/hash boundary design decision.
5. Recommended Jasmin targets: rv64im (minimum), rv64gc_zbb (optimised)
6. Next steps: Jasmin implementation starting with x86-64, hash layer TBD
