# xmss-jasmin

Implementations of XMSS and XMSS-MT ([RFC 8391](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8391)) targeting a Jasmin port for RISC-V.

---

**This implementation was generated by Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5 / Opus 4.6) as part of an experiment into its capabilities. Please DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION under any circumstances at this time -- the code has not been verified as secure and there are known issues with it!**

## What this is

XMSS (eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme) and XMSS-MT (Multi-Tree) are stateful hash-based signature schemes standardised in [RFC 8391](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8391) and approved by NIST as a post-quantum algorithm ([SP 800-208](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-208/final)).

The goal of this project is to provide multiple implementations of the same specification, starting with a C99 reference and targeting a Jasmin port that produces verified RISC-V 64-bit assembly.

## Implementations

| Directory | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| [`impl/c/`](impl/c/README.md) | Complete | C99 reference implementation. All 12 XMSS and 32 XMSS-MT parameter sets. No-malloc, BDS-accelerated, cross-compiles to RISC-V via QEMU. |
| `impl/jasmin/` | Planned | Jasmin implementation targeting RISC-V 64-bit. |

## Repository layout
