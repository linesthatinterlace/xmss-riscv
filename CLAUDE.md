# CLAUDE.md — xmss-jasmin

Multi-implementation XMSS/XMSS-MT project (RFC 8391).

## Implementation routing

Read the CLAUDE.md in the relevant implementation directory for build commands, architecture details, and coding rules.

- **C implementation** (`impl/c/`): Complete C99 reference. See `impl/c/CLAUDE.md` for build commands, architecture, Jasmin portability rules, and test structure.
- **Rust implementation** (`impl/rust/`): Planned. See `impl/rust/CLAUDE.md` for build commands, architecture, and Rust-specific rules.
- **Jasmin implementation** (`impl/jasmin/`): In progress. Targets x86-64 first (mature backend); RISC-V port planned once the Jasmin RISC-V backend matures. See `impl/jasmin/CLAUDE.md`.

## Shared resources

- `doc/rfc8391.txt` -- the RFC 8391 specification. All implementations target this spec including Errata 7900 (SK serialisation byte layout).
- `third_party/xmss-reference/` -- git submodule of the XMSS reference C implementation. **Read-only**: used to understand algorithm logic and regenerate KAT fingerprints. **Do NOT copy code from it** -- our implementations must follow stricter rules (no VLAs, no malloc, no function pointers, etc.) which the reference violates. Only read it to understand algorithm logic, then reimplement from scratch. See `third_party/CLAUDE.md` for how to compile and run the KAT fingerprint generator.
- **formosa-xmss** (`https://github.com/formosa-crypto/formosa-xmss`) -- a human-authored Jasmin implementation of XMSS by the formosa-crypto team, subject to active research. Scope TBD. Relevant prior art for the Jasmin implementation; do not copy from it.

## CI

GitHub Actions CI runs on every push and PR:

- **`ci.yml`**: gcc and clang (native, `-Werror`), all 12 tests (~4 min each).
- **`riscv.yml`**: RISC-V cross-compile + QEMU (fast tests + sign/verify roundtrips). Weekly + manual trigger.

**Prefer pushing and letting CI run the full test suite** rather than running slow tests locally. Use `make test-fast` locally for quick smoke checks, then push to get full coverage across compilers.

Check CI status: `gh run list` / `gh run view <id>` / `gh run watch <id>`

## Cross-cutting research

### RISC-V instruction analysis

Analyses which RISC-V ISA extensions `libxmss.a` actually requires, informing the Jasmin port's target ISA. Artifacts live in `isa/`:

- `isa/scripts/gen_lookup.sh` — generates authoritative mnemonic→extension lookup from `third_party/riscv-opcodes/`
- `isa/scripts/analyse.sh` — disassembles `impl/c/build-rv/libxmss.a`, classifies by extension, detects C encoding from byte width
- `isa/reports/xmss_rv64_isa_profile.md` — full per-object-file results with extension breakdown
- `isa/reports/.report-todo.md` — brief for converting the profile into a PDF report for Francois Dupressoir

**Key findings**: XMSS uses only I + M (M only for compiler address arithmetic). 48% of instructions use C encoding. No A/F/D/Zb*. Zbb (`ror`/`rev8`) is relevant for SHA-2 but not compiler-emitted with `-march=rv64gc`.

See `impl/jasmin/CLAUDE.md` for how these findings affect the Jasmin port strategy.

## Cross-cutting rules

These apply to ALL implementations regardless of language:

- All implementations must target RFC 8391 including Errata 7900.
- Secret-dependent branches and memory accesses must be constant-time. Verification uses constant-time comparison. Annotate any deviations.
- No implementation should depend on `third_party/xmss-reference/` at build time -- it is a development reference only.
